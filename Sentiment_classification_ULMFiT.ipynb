An automated way of calculating the optimal learning rate is to perform a grid search, but this is a time consuming process.\n","\n","In practice, learning rate is not static but changes as training progresses.\n","\n","It is desirable to start with an optimal learning rate (for speed) and gradually decrease it towards the end (for accuracy).\n","\n","Smith discovered a new method for setting learning rate, named Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs). Instead of using a fixed, or a decreasing learning rate, the CLR method allows learning rate to continuously oscillate between reasonable minimum and maximum bounds.\n","\n","More Information at : https://iconof.com/1cycle-learning-rate-policy/"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":79},"id":"Ei8ItPGmU3u9","outputId":"e0745e16-3b9c-4f6c-c551-ea80745189e3"},"source":["learn_cls.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.009)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>epoch</th>\n","      <th>train_loss</th>\n","      <th>valid_loss</th>\n","      <th>accuracy</th>\n","      <th>time</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.358101</td>\n","      <td>0.205374</td>\n","      <td>0.921800</td>\n","      <td>01:18</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zx95K__IU3u9"},"source":["We can pass `-2` to `freeze_to` to freeze all except the last two parameter groups:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":79},"id":"Ha-8BCiNU3u9","outputId":"b717b794-4dbb-4d66-f606-882a70640f26"},"source":["learn_cls.freeze_to(-2)\n","learn_cls.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(1e-2/(2.6**4),1e-2))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>epoch</th>\n","      <th>train_loss</th>\n","      <th>valid_loss</th>\n","      <th>accuracy</th>\n","      <th>time</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.248828</td>\n","      <td>0.185424</td>\n","      <td>0.930400</td>\n","      <td>01:26</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eGf_pI7rU3u9"},"source":["Then we can unfreeze a bit more, and continue training:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":79},"id":"MI6JMylEU3u9","outputId":"c0222b45-de81-47ad-8b03-834bd3633cca"},"source":["learn_cls.freeze_to(-3)\n","learn_cls.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(5e-3/(2.6**4),5e-3))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>epoch</th>\n","      <th>train_loss</th>\n","      <th>valid_loss</th>\n","      <th>accuracy</th>\n","      <th>time</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.191089</td>\n","      <td>0.156836</td>\n","      <td>0.941200</td>\n","      <td>01:57</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MpOJmxP5U3u9"},"source":["And finally, the whole model!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":110},"id":"R_Vfua0sU3u9","outputId":"50d9911b-4dfd-4079-a1e5-2d802ffaf201"},"source":["learn_cls.unfreeze()\n","learn_cls.fit_one_cycle(2, slice(1e-3/(2.6**4),1e-3))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>epoch</th>\n","      <th>train_loss</th>\n","      <th>valid_loss</th>\n","      <th>accuracy</th>\n","      <th>time</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.162609</td>\n","      <td>0.159636</td>\n","      <td>0.942600</td>\n","      <td>02:32</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.149697</td>\n","      <td>0.151581</td>\n","      <td>0.945000</td>\n","      <td>02:32</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jPEZe4eeU3u9"},"source":["We reached 94.5% accuracy, which was state-of-the-art performance just three years ago.
